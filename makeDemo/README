This is a simple demo of how to use "make"  command.
In this makeDemo dir created two C files hello.c and world.c And now the main
objective is to create a make file which can compile all the source code of the
respective files and convert it  into a single exexutable with name "hw".
When u run make command by default it will execute "all" option available in make file.
Another option is to clean all the object(.o) and executable files in the cureent directory.
